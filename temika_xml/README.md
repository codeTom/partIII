### Python XML generator for Temika Microscope Control

Extendable python generator for [Temika scripts](https://temika.fandom.com/wiki/Script).

For more complex tasks, subclass TemikaXML or EasyTemikaXML. See example.py for very simple use, going through a grid, taking a z-stack and using 3 different leds at every point.
